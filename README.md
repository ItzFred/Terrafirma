## Mage class revamp / Spell system

Terrafirma's mage class revamp seeks to overhaul how the class is played in its entirety, this revamp tackles a couple of issues that hold the class back from achieving its full potential. 

**These issues are:**

- The vanilla game's trivialisation of the mana system with features such as the mana flower accessory and its upgrades
- Lack of variety in the class's playstyle and uniqueness compared to other classes, this is in part caused by the first issue

**How does this mod try to fix these issues:**

Terrafirma tries to fix the first issue by revamping accessories and items that are the main cause of the problem, the mana flower and its upgrades have all been stripped of their mana regenerating abilities. Sadly, this doesn't entirely fix the issue as the player is still able to drink mana potions manually and the mana sickness debuff it gives is rather unsubstantial. 

Therefore, additionally to stripping accessories of effects that negatively affect the mana resource, consumables like mana potions are also going to get a few balancing changes.

**Playstyle additions:**

While the easy solution to the second issue may just be adding more weapons and content to the mage class itself, we thought it would be better to try and make each weapon in the vanilla game more interesting. Terrafirma introduces a spell system for most magic weapons. Players now have the ability to switch between different spells specific to each weapon with the ability to add more spells with accessories and other items.

Instead of adding more weapons and overshadowing what's in vanilla already, Terrafirma seeks to bring new life to the vanilla weapons instead to make the base experience feel new and fresh.
